## About me

I'm Alexander Tin, a reporter for CBS News based out of our Washington bureau covering federal public health agencies. In order to find a new home for posting [notes](https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/) that I've been taking, I've started to use Github.

Contact me by email at [TinA@CBSNews.com](mailto:TinA@CBSNews.com) or text/call +1 202-381-7107. You can also DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Alexander_Tin).

If you'd like to reach me securely on [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), please ask me for the separate number I use for those services.
