## Why I'm on Github

I'm not a programmer, but Github has still been useful for staying up to date with experts in my beat about everything from [SARS-CoV-2 variants](https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/) to [disease forecasting](https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub). I also use it to keep [notes](https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/) about what I'm covering.
